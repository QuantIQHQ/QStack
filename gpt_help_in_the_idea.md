🧠 Project: qstack – Fullstack Project Generator for VibeCoders™

A CLI like npm, but smarter — it scaffolds full production-ready projects with everything wired:

    Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind 4.0)

    Backend (Django or FastAPI)

    PostgreSQL or other DB (configurable)

    Dockerized by default

    .env, .dockerignore, .gitignore, README.md, defineprojectscope.md

    Markdown-driven project intelligence — where the vibe coder writes plain English goals, tracks progress, and AI tools use it as context.

🛠 Problem Summary

Right now, it's painful to:

    Set up a project with all modern tools connected and configured (React+Vite+Tailwind+Backend+Docker+DB).

    Switch between DBs, envs, and frontend frameworks.

    Maintain consistent project documentation for AI copilots to follow.

    Get instant working apps out of a prompt or idea.

    Help beginners, hackers, and AI-native devs build and deploy fast.

🎯 Vision for qstack

Command:

qstack startproject my-cool-app --db=postgres --template=fullstack

Outputs:

my-cool-app/
├── backend/ (Django or FastAPI, with DB wired)
├── frontend/ (Vite+React+Tailwind 4)
├── docker/ (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
├── .env
├── README.md
├── defineprojectscope.md  👈 <-- the AI instruction brain
├── qstack.config.json  👈 <-- to track DB, framework, etc.

⚙️ Technical Architecture (MVP)
1. CLI (Python or Node.js based)

    qstack startproject <name>

    Flags: --db=postgres, --frontend=react, --css=tailwind, --docker, etc.

    Uses templating engine (like Cookiecutter or EJS) to copy boilerplate files.

2. Templates

    templates/fullstack/

        Preconfigured:

            Vite + Tailwind + React (vite.config.ts with @tailwindcss/vite)

            Django backend (settings.py, REST ready)

            Docker-ready (multi-container Docker Compose setup)

            PostgreSQL or SQLite support with switch in .env

    Dummy data or fake frontend content for the homepage

3. Smart Markdown Integration

    defineprojectscope.md has structure like:

# Project Name: AI Task Manager

## Purpose
A task manager with AI suggestions.

## Features
- [x] User auth
- [ ] Task creation
- [ ] AI-based task priority
- [ ] Export to Notion

## Instructions for AI
Use simple English. This file is used by Cursor, GPT, etc.

## Developer Notes
Remember to run `docker-compose up` before development.

This gets parsed by tools like ChatGPT or Cursor to help devs move faster without deep diving.
4. Database Config Switcher

Inside qstack.config.json or .env:

{
  "db": "postgres",
  "port": 5432,
  "backend": "django",
  "frontend": "vite-react"
}

You can run:

qstack db switch sqlite

And it auto-rewrites:

    .env

    settings.py or backend config

    Docker volume setup

5. Build + Run Commands

qstack run
# Runs docker-compose, logs shown with clean UI

6. Status + Tracking

qstack status

Parses defineprojectscope.md, shows:

✔ User auth
⏳ Task creation
🧠 AI-based priority

🧨 Innovation Punch

Here’s what will set qstack apart:
Feature	Legacy CLI Tools	QSTACK
Fullstack with AI context	❌	✅
Markdown-based tracking	❌	✅
Tailwind 4.x with Vite	❌	✅
Docker-native from scratch	❌	✅
One-command production app	❌	✅
Switch DBs with 1 line	❌	✅
English-only project flow	❌	✅
📦 MVP Launch Plan

    Backend: Python CLI using Click or Typer

    Templates: Store boilerplates in /templates/fullstack/

    Docker: Multi-container with backend, frontend, db

    First Command: qstack startproject <name>

    Markdown-based tracking

    Deploy Ready: Default Netlify/Vercel/Render setup

🌐 Future Features

    AI-powered project scaffolding via prompt:

    qstack new --ai "a blog with auth and admin dashboard"

    GitHub push integration

    VSCode extension

    Web UI (like Railway or Replit, but open-source)

    Theme marketplace for frontend

🤝 Let's Build It

You're not late. The vibe coder economy is emerging — and tools like this could dominate the future dev stack for:

    Indie hackers

    No-code/low-code ops

    Startups needing speed

    AI-first developers

You want a hackable, modular, composable, modern CLI devkit — that’s what qstack can become.
