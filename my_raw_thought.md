so i have come with this idea , a tool like npm or think of it recognisable in a system , when qstack startproject todo,then its a compelete project with (backend,frontend, Readme.md, .env, database , docker, and defineprojectscope.md(they use to make english comprehensive explanation inoreder they can use ai tools loike curor easy ), do tyou get me , the main problem we having is how willl we have this technologies well connected (react,vite, tailwind(this modern 4.0), django and docker), such that when a vibe corder has the project he only uses the md , and the english is all done , also environment should be well declared, the dummy site, when the project is ran should be perfect and ready for deployment do you get me ???, so we need to be innovative, hackers and well coming with solution of helping vibecoeder have a easy way to come up with a project and deploy as fast as possible, since the world of rp=programmers are changing, so the qstack should support several commands, like startp[roject i think, ca n we also allow them to change the database be setup, come up with hiow we make a mvp working qstack thatsb top level, qstack startproject {name_of_project} ..the modern tailwindcss goes like =>[01
Create your project

Start by creating a new Vite project if you donâ€™t have one set up already. The most common approach is to use Create Vite.
Terminal

npm create vite@latest my-projectcd my-project

02
Install Tailwind CSS

Install tailwindcss and @tailwindcss/vite via npm.
Terminal

npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

03
Configure the Vite plugin

Add the @tailwindcss/vite plugin to your Vite configuration.
vite.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'export default defineConfig({  plugins: [    tailwindcss(),  ],})

04
Import Tailwind CSS

Add an @import to your CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS.
CSS

@import "tailwindcss";

05
Start your build process

Run your build process with npm run dev or whatever command is configured in your package.json file.
Terminal

npm run dev], and also tunning the whole fullstack project qstack command and once, logs and stuff, also i have thought since in the mark down of projectr scope that ai will read through, we should allow them to track what has been inmplemented and tested , so as much as they don't know whats happening they can see and etst, get me, we allow also a place where instructions , like lets make sure they only need simple english in tracjking, giving and knowing 

Also when they are about to deploy qstack build, should cclean unnecessary md, have official md and clean everything to production level.
